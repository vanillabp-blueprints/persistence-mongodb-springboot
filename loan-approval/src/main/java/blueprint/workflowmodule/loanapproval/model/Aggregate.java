/**
 * The workflow aggregate: one document per workflow instance, holding everything the process
 * needs to know. There are no process variables - this is the single source of truth, and it
 * stays a normal document your application can use like any other.
 *
 * <p>
 * Compared to the base blueprint only the mapping changed: a collection instead of a table,
 * and no column declarations, because a document database asks for none. What VanillaBP does
 * with the aggregate is the same, and so is every other class of this workflow module.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The class is annotated {@code @NoSyncWithBPMS}: the aggregate belongs to the application,
 * and the BPMS is given only what a model reads. This model reads nothing of it. There is no
 * condition on a sequence flow, no timer and no multi-instance collection, so no attribute
 * carries {@code @SyncWithBPMS} and the BPMS holds the aggregate's ID alone, which VanillaBP
 * always shares because it is how it finds the workflow again. The day an expression in the
 * model starts reading an attribute, that attribute gets {@code @SyncWithBPMS} and nothing
 * else does.
 * </p>
